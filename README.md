# CPSC 304 (Lost and Found Database)

Along with three other group members, this project is a mock database created using PHP, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and SQL. Users can create an account, make lost or found posts, and query the database for lost or found items. 

## Instructions

* First, download all the files 
* Download and install a [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/), [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/), or [LAMP](http://lamphowto.com/) server 
* Once finished, save all files in the "www" folder
* Download and install [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
* In MySQL Workbench, import the file "Lostnfound_script" to initialize and populate the database, (more can be added on your own!)
* Type "localhost/homepage.php" into your browser, and enjoy!

Here is a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/madhurbhatia89/playlists) that has PHP, SQL, and HTML tutorials that helped me throughout this project. Hope this helps!
